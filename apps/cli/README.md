# @exit-zero-labs/httpi

CLI package for `httpi`, the file-based HTTP workflow runner for humans and AI agents.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @exit-zero-labs/httpi
httpi --version
```

To update an existing global install:

```bash
npm install -g @exit-zero-labs/httpi@latest
httpi --version
```

## Quick start

```bash
httpi init
httpi validate
httpi describe --run smoke
httpi explain variables --request ping
httpi run --run smoke
```

When `--project-root` is omitted, the CLI discovers the nearest `httpi/config.yaml`.

## MCP

`httpi mcp` starts the stdio MCP server for agents.

Because MCP servers are often launched outside the target repository, every MCP tool call must include `projectRoot` pointing at the project directory that contains `httpi/config.yaml`.

## What this package does

- scaffolds a tracked `httpi/` project with `httpi init`
- validates definitions before execution
- runs requests and multi-step runs
- starts `httpi mcp` for MCP clients
- persists sessions and artifacts under `httpi/artifacts/`
- lets you inspect artifacts and explicitly resume paused or failed runs
